## Introduction

Transfer learning is a powerful technique in deep learning that allows us to leverage knowledge learned from one task to solve another related task more efficiently. In this repository, we focus on modifying a pre-trained CNN model to handle input data with a different number of channels. This is particularly useful when you have a pre-trained model but need to adapt it to a new input format.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose based on your preferred framework)
- Basic understanding of deep learning, CNNs, and transfer learning concepts


## Modifying the Model

The `models/pretrained_model.py` file contains the architecture of the pre-trained model. We demonstrate how to modify the model to accommodate a different number of input channels in the `modify_model.ipynb` notebook.

## Training and Fine-tuning

The `train_and_fine_tune.ipynb` notebook explains how to load the modified model, set up a new dataset with the desired number of channels, and fine-tune the model on this dataset. We provide code snippets for both TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks.
